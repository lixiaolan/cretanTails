This is a story about an 18th century fellow who is stranded on a desert island.

I had been established on the beach for perhaps a few days when, early one morning, I awoke to the sound of a distant horn.  Jumping up, scanning the sea for sight of the boat I hoped to see and signal to, I spotted ... nothing; not a shipping vessel, nor a fishing boat, nary a sail.  And yet the sound of a distant horn continued.  Reluctantly giving up my seaward search, I began looking elsewhere and not long after discovered, to my astonishment and disbelief, the source of the sound.

At the base of the cliff, where the vertical rocks met the sand, I spotted two small hemispherical holes, each maybe 1/2" in diameter, perhaps 6' apart.  From each hole issued forth and entered in files of the most extraordinary centipede like creature.  Yellow, with many body segments, each segment marked with a dark grey rectangle, and the head adorned with headlamp like eyes and two curious appendages.  These animalcules proceeded along the pathway between these holes in a slow, comical, lumbering fashion.  But, most remarkably, as one would approach the entrance of its destination hole, it would produce the horn sound, at which the issuing creatures would pause their perambulations to admit their fellow.

On closer inspection, I discovered that the appendages, two silver trumpet-like objects, near the usual antennae, where the source of the honking sound.  Because of this honking and the yellow bus-like appearance of its body, as well as its slow, lumbering motion, I dubbed the creature the Trumpetting Bus Bug.  The purpose of their coming and going and the nature of their habitation within the rock, I never discovered.  However, many an morning, I enjoyed the sound of their not unmelodious trumpeting.
